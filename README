These are the scripts I write as I do my work. You're free to use them but please cite me if you do.

Notes:
Many of the scripts require subfuncs.pl and circlegraph.pl, so unless you are
planning to always call the scripts from the main directory, you might want to add
this directory to your $PERL5LIB variable.

CircleGraph.pm is an object-oriented package that makes it easier to draw graphs along
a circle. It makes postscript objects.

subfuncs.pl is a random hodgepodge of utility functions.

circlegraph.pl has helper functions that draw specific kinds of circular graphs.

The subdirs contain scripts for various tasks:
- converting: helper scripts to convert files from one format to another
- parsing: uses Bioperl to slice and dice sequence files in various ways.
- plastome: scripts that take input about the plastome and draw circle graphs to
  represent that data.
- selection_analysis: scripts that use Bioperl, PAML, HyPhy to analyze selection on genes.
